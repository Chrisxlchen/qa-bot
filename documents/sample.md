# Sample Document for QA Bot Testing

## Introduction

This is a sample document to test the QA Bot functionality. It contains various topics and information that can be used to ask questions.

## Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Examples include:
- Classification (e.g., email spam detection)
- Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples:
- Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., data visualization)

### Reinforcement Learning
The agent learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties:
- Game playing (e.g., chess, Go)
- Robotics and autonomous vehicles

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that combines computational linguistics with machine learning to help computers understand human language. Key applications include:

- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Machine translation
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots and virtual assistants

## Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are particularly useful for:

- Similarity search
- Recommendation systems
- Image and document retrieval
- Embedding storage for ML models

Popular vector databases include ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate, and FAISS.

## Conclusion

This document covers basic concepts in AI, ML, NLP, and vector databases. These technologies work together to create intelligent systems like the QA Bot you're currently testing!
